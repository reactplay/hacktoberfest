# How has Open Source benefited you in your Journey ?

Open source has been one of the deal breakers for me in my career path. It has taken me to different platforms and given me opportunities in various sectors where I wouldn't ordinarily have a say. This article will discuss ways open source has benefited my technical journey.

## Introduction

My first experience with open source was as a technical writer. I had been writing for many blogs but needed help fitting my skills into the open source space. I had an interview for a software engineering role, and one of the tools I was asked to use had a documentation issue. I attempted to fix it and raised a PR. It got merged the following morning🤗! It piqued my interest in being able to volunteer my skills in various communities.

Moving on, I started attending open source events to learn how I could find open source communities and projects to join. I picked up a few, started the journey, and am still contributing today. I also learned about a few open-source internship programs and got accepted into Google Season of Docs 2022. Other programs include [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)(for underrepresented people in tech), and [KDE](https://community.kde.org/Help:Contribute).

These experiences added meaning to my technical journey. I'll talk about how open source has helped me in three ways: through communities, as a software engineer, and as a technical writer.

## Technical Writing

Contributing to open source documentation has helped me develop my writing skills. It allows me to see various documentation strategies across different organizations. Sometimes I get the opportunity to be part of the project community, network with other skilled technical writers, and learn from them. Lately, I got introduced to an open source community that creates processes, templates, and guides covering the numerous aspects of writing good documentation.

Now I am not just writing and contributing to open source projects, but also building guides and templates that will help other open source projects have quality documentation.

## Software Engineering

Many developers find it challenging to contribute to open-source projects because they often think you have to be an expert in a field before you can contribute. This idea is becoming less valid because some open-source projects now have good first issues for beginners, and others are working towards making contributions easy for beginners.

However, one good thing to note from these projects is that they can strengthen your engineering skills. You learn a lot by understanding how the project was implemented and what they are trying to achieve. If the project has good documentation, it allows you to learn some standard concepts in your field and see how they are implemented. When I come across open source projects in my field, I look to understand the codebase, try to fix any existing issues, and learn from the project.

## Communities

Some open source projects have a supportive community around them. If you are not planning to be a drive-by contributor, you should consider joining these communities. Apart from networking opportunities, some have opportunities to teach people how to contribute to their projects or other vital topics in that field. Another benefit I got from communities was speaking opportunities. I meet people who are event organizers or community managers who want me to share my journey with their communities or speak about a particular related topic. I also get the opportunity to pitch myself to a broader audience.

## Conclusion

Generally, open source has also given me more recommendations and collaboration opportunities. It is a journey that I am grateful for, and I always look forward to the outcome. I hope this inspires you to continue contributing to open source while you enjoy the journey!
