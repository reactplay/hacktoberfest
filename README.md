## No-code/Low-code Contributions

Until last year, hacktoberfest contributions were only valid for coding or maintaining a project. Since this year, Hacktoberfest has also been allowing low-code and no-code contributions.  
Here's the table that explains some of the ways of no-code/low-code contributions.
