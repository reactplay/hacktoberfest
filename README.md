# Hacktoberfest
This repository contains a record of all low-code and no-code contributions made during the Hacktoberfest event in the ReactPlay community.


## What is Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a virtual event organized by DigitalOcean and its partners throughout October. It is aimed toward open source and introducing it to as many developers as possible. Anyone regardless of their programming experience are encouraged to contribute to open-source.

## No-code/Low-code Contributions
Until last year, hacktoberfest contributions were only valid for coding or maintaining a project. Since this year, Hacktoberfest has also been allowing low-code and no-code contributions.  
Here's the table that explains some of the ways of no-code/low-code contributions.

| Contribution Type | Low-code | No-code |

| Writing | Technical Documentation | Translating, Copy editing |
| Design | Testing | UX Testing, Graphics design, video production |
| Advocacy | Talks, presentations, blogs, podcasts, case studies | social media blog posts |
